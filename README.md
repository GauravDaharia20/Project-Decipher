# Project-Decipher
We have prepared a deep neural network which classifies the level of any student performance targeting a particular exam, whether the student require any update or not this is the main motive of this neural network.
This neural network had achieved an accuracy of 99.7% in predicting any student performance level and the loss procured by model is 3%. For more details please go through the report attached in this repository.
# In this project we have two module and one visualization part:
   # 1. We have deep neural network which classifies the level of any particular student with respect to the batch of test targeted by student.
   # 2. We have prepared a function or module which tells what are the other courses/batchs a particular student is elegible apart from the targeted batch.
   # 3. We have shared a small data visualization which is done using Tableau, this visualization tell us about some data insights.
