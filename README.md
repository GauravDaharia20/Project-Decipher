# Project-Decipher
We have prepared a deep neural network which classifies the level of any student performance targeting a particular exam, whether the student require any update or not this is the main motive of this neural network.
This neural network had achieved an accuracy of 99.7% in predicting any student performance level and the loss procured by model is 3%. For more details please go through the report attached in this repository.
